<p>Justin Etheredge announced in his <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/post/2010/01/10/Winners-of-the-TekPub-LINQ-Challenge.aspx">post</a> that I am one of the five winners of his LINQ <a href="http://www.codethinked.com/post/2010/01/08/TekPubs-Mastering-LINQ-Challenge.aspx">challenge</a> accompanying his <a href="http://www.tekpub.com/">Tekpub</a> <a href="http://www.tekpub.com/view/linq/1">series on LINQ</a>.</p>  <p>Since I already have a yearly subscription to Tekpub and because tomorrow is my 26th birthday I’m willing to give my coupon away ;-)</p>  <p>As I have been using A LOT of open source projects lately and not participating with coding I want to give something back. If you are an active committer&#160; in any active open source .Net (or jQuery)&#160; project, just leave a comment with your OS project and wished series. I will get the coupon and forward it to you.&#160; Active OS projects are … note very unknown project, you know?</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>== UPDTAE ==</p>  <p>A coupon of “Mastering NHibernate” has already been sent to Krzysztof Koźmic. Have fun with it, Krzysztof :-)</p>
